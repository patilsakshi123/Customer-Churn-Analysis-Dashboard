# üìä CHURN ANALYSIS DASHBOARD PROJECT

This project showcases a complete end-to-end solution for analyzing and predicting customer churn using real-world data. 
The dashboard was built using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python (Random Forest) for machine learning.

## üîß Key Features:

1) ETL Pipeline: Built robust data pipelines in SQL Server for importing, cleaning, and transforming customer data (demographics, services, payments, churn).

2) Power BI Visualizations: Created dynamic dashboards to track churn rate, customer segmentation, revenue insights, and service usage.

3) Data Modeling: Designed an efficient data model and implemented DAX measures for KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners.

4) Machine Learning Integration: Developed a Random Forest model in Python to predict churn; evaluated with classification report and confusion matrix.

5) Predictive Dashboard: Integrated ML predictions into Power BI to visualize high-risk customers and support business decisions.

6) UI Enhancements: Applied custom themes, layout design, and visual storytelling for better user experience and insight delivery.

  *Insight:* Churn rates progress clearly by Internet Type: **Fiber Optic ‚Üí Cable ‚Üí DSL ‚Üí None.**  
  *Insight:* Overall, churn spans from **7.84%** to **41.10%** across these four internet service categories, highlighting the stark contrast in customer retention.

- **Clustered Bar Chart: Churn Rate by Payment Method**
  *Insight:* **Mailed Check* has the **highest churn rate** at **37.82%*, which is 155.63% higher than Credit Card, the lowest at 14.80%.  
  *Insight:* **Bank Withdrawal** follows closely with a churn rate of **34.43%**, highlighting that traditional payment methods see higher churn compared to digital options.

### üìç 2. Prediction Dashboard (Powered by Machine Learning):


The Prediction Dashboard takes things a step further by using machine learning to identify customers who are most likely to churn. Powered by a Random Forest regression model, it displays each customer's churn risk alongside key details like their profile and service usage‚Äîenabling the business to take proactive steps before it's too late.
